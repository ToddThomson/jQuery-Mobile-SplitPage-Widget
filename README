Coming Soon...

Dec 16th, Screen shot added
Page extension "SplitPage' plugin created with:
  - full markup completed based on <div data-role="page" data-splitpage="true"> and 2 defined pane widgets.
  - very early click handling of master pane updating detail pane.
  - basic fixed headers and footer css for master and detail panes

Dec 19th, Fixed Headers and Scrollable regions CSS is now good.
  - Listview with native scroll only updates after scroll has completed???
      - Determined to be caused by ui-li { ..position:relative; .. }
      - Any ui-li with position:relative; will not be visible when scrolled into the viewing window until scrolling completes
  - good independent scrolling in both panes!
  - scrollbars in Mac Safari and iPad simulator line up perfectly with scrollable region.
  - Added index.cshtml and _layout.cshtml to show CSS rules

Will try to get an early preview up soon..
